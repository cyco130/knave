# Knave

Knave is a MIT-licensed client-side navigation library that tries to [get it right](https://github.com/cyco130/knave/blob/main/design.md). Currently it consists of two packages:

- [`knave`](https://github.com/cyco130/knave/tree/main/packages/knave): Frame-work agnostic core
- [`knave-react`](https://github.com/cyco130/knave/tree/main/packages/knave-react): React bindings

PRs that implement bindings for other frameworks are very welcome.
